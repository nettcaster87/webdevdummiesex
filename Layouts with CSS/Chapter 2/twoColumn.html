		<h2>Left column</h2>
		<p>The colored backgrounds in Figure 2-4 point out some important features of
this layout scheme. For instance, the two columns are not the same height.
This can have important implications.</p>

	<div id="right">
		<h2>Right Column</h2>
		<p>This type of layout scheme (with floats and variable widths) is often called a
fluid layout because it has columns but the sizes of the columns are depen-
dent on the browser width. This is an important issue because, unlike layout
in the print world, you really have no idea what size the browser window
that displays your page will be. Even if the user has a widescreen monitor,
the browser may be in a much smaller window. Fluid layouts can adapt to
this situation quite well.
Fluid layouts (and indeed all other float-based layouts) have another great
advantage. If the user turns off CSS or canâ€™t use it, the page still displays.
The elements will simply be printed in order vertically, rather than in the
intended layout. This can be especially handy for screen readers or devices
with exceptionally small screens, like phones.</p>
