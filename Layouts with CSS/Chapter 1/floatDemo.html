	<p id="par1"> Paragraph 1. This paragraph has the normal behaviour of a block-level element. It takes up the entire width of the page, and the next element is placed underneath.</p>
	
	<p id="par2">Paragraph 2. Adjusted the width of this paragraph to 50%. This parapgraph is floated left. It is palced to the left, and the next element will be placed to the right of it.</p>

	<p id="par3">Paragraph 3. This paragraph has no floating width or margin. It takes whatever space it can to the right of the floated element and then flows to the next line.</p>
